<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF" size="2">As
specialist brokers, European Business Development continuously network with
accountants, solicitors, corporate finance firms, banks, venture capital
companies, and professionals engaged in corporate acquisitions and disposals.
Through these contacts and subscription to specialist publications and on-line
directories, we receive early notification of companies that are for sale,
considering a sale, or &quot;open to offers&quot;, and are therefore well placed
to provide acquisition search services for clients.<o:p>
&nbsp;</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF" size="2"><br>
We initially meet with clients, without obligation, to discuss their business,
its future plans and objectives. We then consider acquisition criteria and
compile a target company profile.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF" size="2"><br>
For clients actively seeking acquisitions, we offer a dedicated search service
where we are retained to proactively locate target acquisitions. We undertake
market sector research to determine companies broadly meeting a client's
acquisition criteria. We organise mail shots, make discreet approaches, identify
vendors who would be receptive to an approach, arrange confidentiality
documentation, and organise exploratory meetings.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF" size="2"><br>
Alternatively, for clients with a general interest in acquisitions, and no fixed
timescales, we are happy to enter their details onto our database free of
charge, and they will be supplied with details of appropriate companies for sale
as they are received by us. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF" size="2"><br>
Where clients are interested in a merger or strategic alliance rather than an
outright sale or purchase, we provide search services to locate potential
opportunities.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF" size="2"><br>
Our fee structure is competitive and agreed in advance of our accepting an
appointment. With the exception of a commitment fee already stated where we
undertake dedicated acquisition or merger searches for clients, our fees are
success related, payable on completion of the transaction – no purchase, no
fee. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF" size="2"><br>
Once an acquisition target had been identified and a deal agreed, we can provide
a comprehensive range of services, or we are happy to work with existing
advisers.<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><o:p>

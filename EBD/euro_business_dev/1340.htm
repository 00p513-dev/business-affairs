<b><u>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Revised Business Plan for 2003/4 year</p>
</u></b><font SIZE="4">
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Introduction</p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This business plan updates and supersedes the one presented
and accepted at the July 2003 board meeting. This revised plan reflects the
trading conditions in the second half of 2003 calendar year, and the intentions
of the company to acquire further companies during 2004. As these negotiations
are still ongoing there has to be some degree of variance in the actual dates
when the new companies will be absorbed into the existing operations. The Board
at their meeting on Thursday 8th January 2004 adopted the revised plan.</p>
<b><u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Background.</p>
</u></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Company intends to continue to concentrate on the technical
rather than commodity end of injection moulding, in order to maintain the higher
margins available on the technical work. However there are now severe pressures
on margins on the technical moulding work as moulding companies all scramble to
win this work. The existing operation has been restructured and organised to
service a much higher volume of business than it is currently processing and can
therefore absorb a considerable expansion of turnover, without making
significant changes to the overhead costs. Over the past year the Company has
seen a 120% increase in turnover, of which 77% has been organic growth. The rest
has come from an acquisition made in July 2002. The first 4 months of the
current financial year have already secured a further 27% organic growth and
this is expected to continue to grow over the remaining portion of the year.
However, it is believed that more dramatic growth still can be achieved by the
acquisition of other companies and this should boost the annualised turnover of
the company to around the £3m mark by the financial year-end. The Company has
demonstrated that it can manage its growth by returning a small profit on 8 of
the last 10 months of trading.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the last year, the management team has been working
together and planning for the next stage of their expansion. The team comprises
the core management group encompassing the founder and Managing Director, with a
very strong technical moulding background; the Sales Manager with very good
commercial awareness; the acting General Manager / Chairman with very good
industrial background; the Quality Manager with very strong Automotive /
Aerospace systems background; the Purchasing Manager with a very strong plastics
background; the acting Production Manager with very strong shop floor technical
skills and the Office Manager who ensures that all the commercial and system
matters are kept in line. Behind all these key team members are their
departments, dedicated to meeting the highest possible customer satisfaction
objectives, which in turn will help drive the whole company forward.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After detailed analysis work 3 companies have been selected
and have declared that they are interested in becoming part of the Company,
subject to contract exchange. These companies have been selected because they
are also technical moulders and have complimentary work and processes to that
already undertaken by the Company. The owners of the companies are all seeking a
retirement exit route and their aspirations can be met through a commission
based payment on the sales transferred to the Company. There will be minimal
up-front payments to these companies, but there will be the incorporation, legal
and physical costs of the move to be funded as well as the site closure costs.
Where possible cost offsets will be done with the former owners of these
businesses to minimise the cash requirements of the acquisitions.</p>
<b><u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Outline information on the 3 target companies.</p>
</u></b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this stage the names of the 3 companies are not being
disclosed for reasons of confidentiality and non-disclosure undertakings given
to their owners, so they are referred to as company 1,2 &amp; 3. Some general
information is given about each company and target completion dates.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Company 1</b> is based in the North Midlands and has a
current turnover of just over £0.5m. They manufacture technical mouldings on
25-270t machines, a small amount of presswork and have their own small tool
room. They supply a number of relatively small businesses around their general
locality but their physical location is not thought to be fundamental to their
business. Component, tool design and manufacture are also offered. The company
is operating out of fairly run down premises and the owners are looking to
retire and emigrate once the business is transferred and bedded down. The
company is making a profit of around £40k at present and this should be
increased, after commissions, to around £140k after transfer into the Company,
by saving a major part of their existing overhead structure, as these services
and costs are already in place at the Company. This would be the last business
to transfer and should be starting to move by the end of July 2004.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Company 2</b> is based in the South and has a current
turnover of £0.8m. They manufacture small technical mouldings mainly on 15-100t
machines and have their own rudimentary tool repair room. They supply a very
large number of customers with a combination of trade mouldings and own
products. The company is operating out of a variety of fairly run down
non-contiguous premises and the owner is looking to retire once the business is
transferred and bedded down. The company is making a small loss of around £2k
at present and this would be changed into a profit, after commissions, of around
£150k post transfer into the Company, by saving a major part of their existing
overhead structure, as these services and costs are already in place at the
Company. We plan to make this the first business to transfer and this should be
starting to move by the end of March 2004.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Company 3</b> is based in the Midlands and has a current
turnover of £0.6m. They manufacture technical mouldings and a small amount of
commodity mouldings on 23-300t machines and have no tool room. They supply
mouldings to a number of automotive and industrial customers. The company is
operating out of fairly run down premises and the owners are looking to exit
from the business once transferred and bedded down. The company is making a
profit of around £35k at present and this should be increased, after
commissions, to around £235k after transfer into the Company, by saving a major
part of their existing overhead structure, as these services and costs are
already in place at the Company. This should be the second business to transfer
and this should be starting to move by the end of May 2004.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Integration of the 3 companies into the Company.</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As indicated above it is planned to integrate the companies
into the Company operation at 2 monthly intervals. This should allow time to bed
down the new work and assimilate the customer base. It will require a lot of
office administrative and technical work over this period to ensure a smooth
transition. It will also probably require the previous owners to spend at least
a month at the Company during each initial 2 month period after the transfer
from their site. Economically we will need to close down their operation as fast
as possible in order to crystalise the savings in overheads. It is planned that
their sites should be completely closed no later than 2 months from the start of
their move to the Company site.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In general it is believed that the underlying structure of
the existing Company site and operational systems will be able to expand to
incorporate the extra workload. However there are some key areas which will need
to be addressed and will require some expenditure.</p>
<i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Staffing.</i> The extra workload will require us to
re-instate the 3<sup>rd</sup> shift that was laid off in the autumn of 2003.
This will require the recruitment of an additional setter / supervisor and the
necessary operators to run the shift. This is already in the Company budget. It
is also believed that the site will need a proper site production manager. This
role is at present split across a number of functions. It is not believed that
there is a candidate on site capable to undertaking the function so a new person
will have to be recruited. It is also believed that it will be necessary to
recruit a couple more apprentices for the manufacturing operation. One will be
needed to help out on day-to-day tasks on the Moulding shop floor and a second
one to support the QC / inspection function. When company 3 comes onto the site
(May 2004) it will be necessary to demonstrate that the Company is running to
the TS automotive quality standards. From initial evaluations undertaken at the
Company it is believed that the site is already almost running to this standard
so there should not be too much extra work to implement and be certified to this
standard. The above extra staff will cost about £50k with NI but it is believed
that equivalent savings (from their direct operating costs) should be achievable
from the incoming 3 companies, in addition to those savings already shown from
their overheads.</p>
<i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Systems.</i> The extra volume of work will show up some of
the shortcomings in the present manually operated MRP system. A proper MRP
systems suite will have to be installed on site and this will need suitable
familiarisation and training time. The system should ideally be installed ahead
of the transfer of the first company in order to avoid double handling of their
data. In addition to the software cost of between £10-20k there will be a
further spend of about £10k on hardware.</p>
<i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Space.</i> It has been planned for a while to install a
Mezzanine floor over the toolroom and some of the offices at the Company. It has
not been done already, as the volume of work had not justified it yet. With the
arrival of the extra workload it will have to be installed in order to create
more space on the shop floor. It will have the added advantage of removing most
of the operators off the shop floor, which will in turn allow some of the
moulding machines to be run closer together, generating space for additional
machines, as and when needed. In order to get the mouldings away from the
moulding machines and up to the Mezzanine floor a series of elevating conveyors
will be needed. In due course robots on the larger machines will feed these. To
start with a few shorter feed conveyors can be used from the larger moulding
machines. The mezzanine and the conveyors will require about £50k of
investment.</p>
<i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other infrastructure items.</i> The workload for company 2
includes a lot of work that is handled by about 20 home workers. In due course
it is expected that their moulds will be adapted / modified to reduce, but will
not fully eliminate, the amount of home working that is required. There are not
enough local people in wanting to undertake the home working so it will be
necessary to go slightly further a field. Almost certainly this will mean that
we will have to arrange the delivery and collection of the work so a small van
will become necessary. The van would be leased. The availability of such a
vehicle will also have other uses, which will save having to use the current
Sales Manager or MD’s vehicle for a variety of collection and delivery trips.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be other infrastructure items that will be
required, such as storage for more tools, drawings, papers and records. All of
this should be available for only a nominal cost from the closure of the 3
acquired companies. Likewise if it is decided that any of the main capital items
of plant are required from the acquired companies, either because of capacity or
the fact that their plant offers advantages over the existing Company plant,
then the aim will be to acquire it at nominal cost or on favourable lease terms
from the acquired company.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Closure assumptions for the 3 companies.</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this business plan it has been assumed that the 3 acquired
companies will all be acquired on the following basis.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. The owners will relinquish control of their companies
    in return for a percentage fee based on the actual sales made by the Company
    on the acquired turnover for a set number of years. This fee will be paid on
    a quarterly basis in arrears. This arrangement offers the former owners a
    tax efficient retirement route and an ongoing income stream for a number of
    years.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. The owners will be responsible for the sale and
    disposal of all remaining plant and equipment on their site, termination of
    the lease and any staff closure costs. Anything left over from the sale,
    after payment of closure costs, to be theirs. In effect the Company will
    therefore be acquiring mainly the order book and tools from the companies.
    The Company may choose to select some plant and sundry equipment for
    purchase and transfer to the Company site at auction prices or on rental
    terms to be agreed with the former owners.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. The Company will be responsible for the transfer of
    all stock, whether of raw materials or finished goods, and the transfer of
    all tools and fixtures. Details of any payments for raw materials and stock
    will be worked out on a case-by-case basis. Transfer of title of any wholly
    owned tools or fixtures would pass to the Company as part of the contract,
    as will the company names once the operation is closed.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. The former owners may be given limited rights of
    access / seat on the Company Board for a specified period after their
    acquisition.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Investment sought and shareholding implications.</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to strengthen the company finances, provide funds
for the costs of the acquisitions and some infrastructure modifications an
investment of £250,000 is being sought from an external investor. Ideally this
would be as a lump sum but could be phased, to some degree, as shown in the cash
flow forecast. In order to attract the investor quickly, it is believed that we
will need to allocate up to 25% of the shareholding in the company to this
investor. The existing 3 shareholders would therefore have to drop their
existing shareholding proportionately. Depending on the new shareholders wishes
there may be a Board seat option. The new shareholder should therefore see a
return of their investment via dividends in about 2 years and the potential for
a 2.5 times return in 5 years. In the longer term there may be the possibility
of an AIM float if the company continues its growth at the same rate in future
years.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The timing of the growth is now critical as the target
companies have been identified and have declared they are ready to be acquired.
If we delay the acquisitions then there is a danger that someone else may
acquire them, and a delay would have further implications on the cash
requirements for the ongoing Company operations. It is accepted that the growth
plan is ambitious but the benefits flowing from the growth are such that it is
believed that it is the best route forward for the Company.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company offers the following services.</p>
</font><u><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="5">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Design</p>
</font></u><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2 Dimensional Design:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AutoCAD LT® Allows us to Design and Present information
quickly on a computer; and make any necessary changes with greater ease. We also
have the luxury of delivering you drawings instantly across the Internet via
e-mail!</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3 Dimensional Design:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We use a design package called Solidworks 2000®. With a
highly trained design team, we can create almost anything in 3 dimensions. This
can help us see what the final part will look like, and modify the design at an
early stage.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moldflow analysis:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With an excellent new package, called Moldflow, we can
predict the way a part is going to fill when we commence production. With this
package, we can select the optimum injection point(s), the best machine to use
and also, how much time will be needed to produce each part; thus giving us the
opportunity to provide accurate and&nbsp; detailed production information about
the part we have developed.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To further enhance the vision of the design, we can produce
rapid prototypes using the latest computer technology. From this, solid models
can be manufactured quickly and cost-effectively, using the STL file format;
generating models in SLA and SLS. These models can also be used to provide small
quantities of components, using vacuum casting.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CNC Manufacture:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We use two programs together to give us the capability of
taking a 3-Dimensional model, or a 2-Dimensional engineering drawing, and make a
CNC program to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; produce a high quality tool that fits the
specifications of the model exactly. We use Alpha Cam and Alpha Edit. Alpha Cam
is the design part of this process, and Alpha Edit manipulates the drawing that
we produce into a language that the CNC machinery can understand.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Internet and Communication:</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have the capability to send animated, detailed designs
over the Internet, containing our notes ideas and modifications. We can also
give details of our findings during the design stage in an informative and
professional layout, simply by e-mail.</p>
<u>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prototyping:</u></p>
